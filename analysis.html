	<h1>Fat Wreck Chords</h1>
    <h3> Project: Website Redesign |  Designer: Rene Trejo Jr. | 03/2013 | Document: Project Analysis </h3>

    <h2> Site Intent</h2>
    <p>Fat Wreck Chords is a well known, established record label in the punk music scene. The site, lives up to the "punk style" as everything seems to just be thrown together quickly on the fly, with little organization. Cleaner, crisp, organization is vital in the redesign of this site. There were no significant validation errors running this site through the WC3 Validator test, which is good. But, unlike many sites built within the past couple of years, this site is not built for mobile devices, which is a necessity in this day and age.</p>
    <p>A major overhaul is recommended and will be applied but with that being said, being able to keep the site with some of its punk attitude is key, as many fans of bands on Fat Wreck Chords embrace the "DIY" (Do It Yourself) attitude
 and thus, we need not lose focus on that aspect of their brand.</p>

 <h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
 <p>Comparing the Fat Wreck Chords site to other record label sites, there is a clear and distinct advantage UI and UX wise to the competitors sites, as they have embraced and updated their sites to reflect the changing times as they realize many of their visitors are viewing their site from a tablet or mobile phone.</p>
 <p>The site's visitors view 4.0 unique pages each day on average. Approximately 37% of visits to it are bounces (one pageview only). Fatwreck.com is located in the US. The site has a relatively good traffic rank in the city of Yuma (#743) - Alexa.com</p>
 <hr>
 <h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
 <p>Fat Wreck Chords is a predominately punk rock based record label, thus the target audience for the site ranges from 18 - 34 year olds and is more looked at by males than females. Given this information, we can keep the "DIY" mentality of the site, while still bringing it up to par with more current sites.</p>
